# Python Fundamentals
A brief introduction to strings, data types, if statements and logical programming operators. 

## Description
As tasked by the HyperionDev software engineering Bootcamp. 
This repository contains 4 files exploring the fundamental basics with Python.

### Understanding Variables
- This explores how to print strings and save variables in different data types.

### String Data Types
- This file explores using different methods in order to manipulate a string.

### If Blocks & Boolean Data Types
- This file explores building if statements to control different outputs to a user, based on certain parameters being met.

### Logical Programming Operators
- This file takes the previous knowledge explored to create a program that takes user input from those competeing in a triathalon. 
It then stores information in a string, utilizes if statements to notify the user.

## Project usage
This repository exists to showcase my abilities to work with the fundamental basics of python.
